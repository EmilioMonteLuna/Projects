# Electricity Demand Forecasting

## Overview

This project analyzes and forecasts electricity demand for New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria (VIC) using historical data from the Australian electricity market (1996â€“1998). Accurate demand forecasting helps utilities optimize generation, manage resources, and maintain grid stability.

## Dataset

- **Source:** [Kaggle - Electricity Demands](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- **Description:** Half-hourly records of electricity demand for NSW and VIC, scheduled transfers, and price movement class labels, from May 1996 to December 1998.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Exploration**
   - Checked for missing values and explored demand patterns.
   - Visualized daily and weekly cycles in electricity demand.

2. **Forecasting Approach**
   - Used ARIMA time series models to forecast electricity demand for both regions.
   - Split data into training (first 90%) and testing (last 10%) sets.

3. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluated model performance using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
   - Compared actual vs. predicted demand visually.

4. **Findings**
   - ARIMA models captured the overall demand trend but missed some short-term volatility.
   - RMSE (normalized units) was approximately 0.15, indicating ~15% average error on the scaled data.

## Key Results

- **Demand Patterns:** NSW demand is consistently higher than VIC, with clear daily and weekly cycles.
- **Model Performance:** The ARIMA model provides a reasonable baseline for forecasting, but could be improved with more advanced models or additional features.
- **Business Impact:** Improved demand forecasting can help utilities reduce costs, prevent blackouts, and better integrate renewables.
